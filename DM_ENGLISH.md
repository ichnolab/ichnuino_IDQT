# **DEVICE MANIFEST**  (english)

The main purpose of the device is to classify the iphone white screen quality of OEM&A/M display spare-parts. 
Although the general quality of an aftermarket iphone display-assy part takes into account many other factors 
(touch quality, angular visibility, polarization, frame gluing, circuitry,flexes,etc), the brightness and
color temperature of the white screen is an important feature to which the customer pays close attention, 
and easily compare the new display with a friend's original one.

Many of the aftermarket replacement display suppliers show the quality of their product with images of their parts
compared to the original and the competition, always on a white screen to highlight the differences in tone and brightness.
This device aims to provide a tool, and a relative standard of values, to make quality assessment an objective, 
measurable and classifiable data (in this case on a scale of 5 levels: A / AA / AAA / AAA + / TOP_Q). 

Useful for those who buy, who have a concrete reference on which to base themselves in choosing a supplier,
and also useful for those who sell, who can demonstrate with the numbers and on a standard platform the quality 
of the product they offer.

Provided that if you want a complete, detailed and certified quality certification this is not the right tool
(for that purpose it is better to buy for example a spyder5 for â‚¬150 or something more professional),
this tool can be useful and easy to use for a classification clear and simple of the display quality,
easier to understand compared to complex professional reports, specially for the end customer who better understands
an happy emoji  and a AAA-scale than a slew of complex numbers and data.
